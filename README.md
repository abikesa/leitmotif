Yes, "Die Zauberflöte" (The Magic Flute) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart features several leitmotifs, including one for the character Papageno. Papageno's leitmotif is light-hearted and whimsical, reflecting his character as a bird catcher and a comic figure. This theme often includes elements that mimic bird calls, aligning with his persona and his occupation within the opera. The use of leitmotifs in "Die Zauberflöte" helps to distinguish characters and themes, contributing to the overall storytelling and musical narrative. 

Mozart's skill in using these motifs is part of what makes "Die Zauberflöte" so enchanting and memorable. Papageno's music, in particular, brings a charming and humorous element to the opera, making him one of the most beloved characters.

Leitmotifs are indeed most famously associated with Richard Wagner, who extensively developed and popularized their use in his operas. However, the concept of using recurring musical themes to represent characters, ideas, or emotions does precede Wagner and can be found in earlier works, including those of Mozart (Papagino).

Before Mozart, the idea of recurring musical themes can be traced back to composers such as Jean-Baptiste Lully and Christoph Willibald Gluck, who used similar techniques in their operas to some extent. For example, Lully's operas contain recurring musical ideas associated with specific characters or situations. 

However, it was with Mozart that the use of these themes began to take on a more defined and sophisticated role, particularly in operas like "Die Zauberflöte" and "Don Giovanni." While these themes were not as intricately woven into the entire structure of the opera as Wagner would later do, they nonetheless served a similar purpose in helping to reinforce the narrative and emotional content of the story. In short, the use of leitmotifs as a concept does predate Wagner, and Mozart was one of the key figures in its development before it reached its full expression in Wagner's works. Wagner, however, took the concept to new heights, integrating leitmotifs more systematically and innovatively than his predecessors.
